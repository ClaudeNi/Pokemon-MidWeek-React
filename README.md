# Pokemon-MidWeek-React
A react project where I built a small Pokemon game.

## Info
Over one week we had to create our own React app by using a couple of things:
- APIs
- React Router
- Use Hooks
- And more!

The game itself is a single Pokemon team builder for both you and your enemy where you select your Pokemon from a huge collection found in generation 1 to 5, including the up to 4 attack moves!  
After that you can battle the enemy that uses a simple AI to pick an attack in a standard turn based battle until someone dies.  
  
Normal mode is your typical Pokemon JRPG game but it's still a work in progress!

## Site
  
In the Landing page, you get to register or login into your account so that we can save the progress in normal mode in my own mockAPI.

In the title screen is where the player chooses what game mode to play, whether it's normal or custom battle.

The team builder page is where the player gets to select their pokemon from a big selection and then decide on the attack moves for both them and the enemy.

And of course there is the battle screen where the player can use the Pokemon they set up to try them out as a level 100 Pokemon and have a little fun against the enemy AI.
